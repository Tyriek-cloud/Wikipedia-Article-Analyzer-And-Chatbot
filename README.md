# Wikipedia-Article-Analyzer-NLP-Streamlit-App
Wikipedia Article Analyzer

This project is designed to scrape articles from Wikipedia. By default, the Streamlit application will display the Wikipedia Statistics page (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics). The user will have the option to insert their own Wikipedia URLs. The end goal is to use Natural Language Processing to create a summary (with an emphasis on important and easily digestable details) from Wikipedia articles and display important images/pictures/graphics from each of the articles.

# Summary

The application generates a summary of 10+ sentences. The sentences are intended to pull crucial facts about the article. As opposed to reading an entire article, this can save a user time.

# Image URLs

This will pull in links to images from the Wikipedia article. These URLs are clickable and will generate a seperate webpage. The images can then be copied for personal use.

# IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER

The structure of the Wikiepedia article may impact whether a summary is actually generated. Image URLs are always pulled in.
